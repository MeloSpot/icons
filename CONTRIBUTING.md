## Code Style & Best Practices

- Follow the projectâ€™s **TypeScript and React conventions**.
- Use **Prettier** and **ESLint** for consistent formatting.
- Ensure icons use `currentColor` for proper theming.
- Keep the **icon size responsive** by defaulting to `24px`.
- Ensure new icons are **accessible** (e.g., using `aria-label` when needed).
